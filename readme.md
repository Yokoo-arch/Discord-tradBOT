__The Translation Bot__ is a __Discord bot__ built using the __discord.js library and Node.js__. It provides translation capabilities using the __DeepL API__, allowing users to easily translate text between different languages within their __Discord server__.

__Important:__ This repository is made for __dev__ or at least for people with a bit of code __knowledge__.
## Features

- __Multiple Languages__: With support for a wide range of languages, users can translate text to and from various languages, enabling effective communication across language barriers.
- __DeepL API Integration:__ The bot leverages the power of the DeepL API, which offers high-quality and accurate translations, ensuring reliable and precise language conversions.
- __Command-Based Interface:__ Users can trigger translations by using simple commands, making it intuitive and user-friendly to utilize the bot's translation capabilities.
## Getting Started

To use the __Traduction Bot__ in your server (or just understand how it works) you will need to follow those step:

- __Create a new application__ (then a bot): [how to create a bot](https://v12.discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).
- __Set Up API Key:__ Obtain an API key from the DeepL API and configure it within the bot's settings. This key is necessary for the bot to access the translation functionality. By the way you can get one for free [DeepL API Pricing](https://www.deepl.com/pro?cta=header-prices).
